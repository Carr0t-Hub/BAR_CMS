              Warm greetings from the Department of Agriculture-Bureau of Agricultural Research (DA-BAR)!
              <br>
              As part of our commitment to be transparent with its processes and provide information on the latest innovations of all our agri-fisheries Research for Development and Extension (R4DE) initiatives, it is with great pleasure that I present to you our enhanced website.
              <br>
              We have provided through this website the bureau’s history, mandate, and aspirations; our operating procedures, functions, and services; and, a list of opportunities to work at the bureau.
              <br>
              Moreover, this page chronicles the bureau&#39;s accomplishments, on-going programs and activities, and links to our partner research institutions . You can access these in the form of news, feature stories, photo releases, infographics, videos, newsletters, magazines, and reports.
              <br>
              We, at DA-BAR, recognize the importance of providing easily accessible and factual information. As we establish our enhanced website, the bureau also vows to uphold credibility in providing resources vital to our agri-fishery sector– an extra mile we take directed towards our efforts in improving the lives of our farmers and fisherfolks.
